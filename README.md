# Few-shot Learning of CT Stroke Segmentation Based on U-Net

In order to solve the shortcomings of computer tomography and gain time for doctors to treat patients, we try to use deep learning to help doctors diagnose ischemic stroke. Since it is not easy to obtain images and the amount of data is small, we use few-shot learning to solve our problem.

We've tested several segmentation model and different activation function to find the best stroke segmentation model. Moreover, we used the skill of image clustering to improve the performance of the model in view of the lack of data.
